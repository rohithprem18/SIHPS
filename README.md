## Name: Rohith Prem S
## Problem Title
Online personalized learning remediation/tutoring tool. Search for best teacher for specific topics.

## Problem Description
The goal is to develop a model or software that assists students in selecting the best teacher or relevant information for specific topics. This tool should facilitate personalized learning experiences.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Education

## Idea
Creating a platform that matches students with the best teachers for their individual learning needs can revolutionize education. By offering personalized learning experiences, students can receive tailored guidance and support, enhancing their understanding and mastery of various subjects. The platform could utilize algorithms to assess students' learning styles, strengths, and areas for improvement, and then match them with teachers who excel in addressing those needs. Additionally, features such as progress tracking, feedback mechanisms, and resources for both students and teachers could further enrich the learning experience. Overall, such a platform has the potential to greatly optimize learning outcomes and empower both students and educators.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
Our platform utilizes collaborative and content-based filtering to recommend teachers and content based on individual preferences, past performance, and topics of interest. We ensure alignment with curriculum standards through topic mapping and NLP techniques. Personalized learning paths consider proficiency level, pace, and teaching style preferences. The user-friendly interface offers search functionality, displaying detailed teacher profiles with verified credentials. Continuous feedback from students refines recommendations, enhancing the learning experience.
